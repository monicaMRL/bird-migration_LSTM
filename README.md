# bird-migration_LSTM
This was the project I did under Prof. Joelle Pineau.

Abstract: White storks are migratory birds that have a diverse migratory pattern that often causes varied wintering locations among juvenile birds within the species. Birds that winter in areas with a higher human population tend to behave differently from those that donâ€™t. Since they are affected by their ecological system, it would be beneficial to map out their widespread migration patterns. A better understanding of what areas are affecting the birds in their migration routes would help in knowing where to concentrate conservation efforts. We develop several algorithms to help us to help us predict migratory patterns of these birds. First we cluster the birds in order to find out which birds are travelling together so we can map out maps for these clusters. Since we are working with time series data we then use LSTM and compare it with a regression model to predict future paths.
